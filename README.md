# Future-Sales-Prediction

This repository focuses on predicting future sales figures using machine learning techniques.

Project Goal:
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can forecast future sales for products or stores. This can be valuable information for businesses to optimize inventory management, resource allocation, and marketing strategies.

What's Included:
•	future_sales_prediction.ipynb (or a similar filename): Jupyter Notebook containing the core logic for data preparation, model training, and evaluation for future sales prediction.
•	data (Optional): Folder containing the historical sales data used to train the model.
•	models (Optional): Folder containing trained machine learning models (if the project saves the models for future use).

How to Use:
1.	Prerequisites: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and a time series library like statsmodels or prophet (depending on the chosen approach).
2.	Data Preparation: If the data is provided, explore the data folder and familiarize yourself with the format of the sales data (e.g., product IDs, timestamps, sales quantities). You might need to modify the data loading section in the notebook to match your specific data structure.
3.	Run the Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., future_sales_prediction.ipynb) in your Jupyter Notebook environment and execute the cells sequentially (or use the "Run All" option). This will guide you through data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and potentially visualization of the predicted sales.

Further Exploration:
•	Experiment with different machine learning models suitable for time series forecasting, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or deep learning models like LSTMs.
•	Compare the performance of various models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
•	Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to improve its forecasting accuracy.
•	Visualize the predicted sales alongside actual historical data to assess the model's effectiveness.
